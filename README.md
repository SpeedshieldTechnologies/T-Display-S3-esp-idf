# ST7789V (T-Display-S3) from LilyGo example using LVGL V8.3.6

### Hardware Required

- T-Display-S3 development board (https://www.lilygo.cc/products/t-display-s3)

- An USB cable for power supply and programming

### Hardware

Detailed description of T-Display-S3 development board can be found here:

https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-Display-S3

### How to use the example

This example project was built and tested using esp-idf v5.0.1

In order to try different LVGL functions, uncomment the following functions one by one in main.c

```
// display_meter();

// display_image();

// display_window();

// display_dropdown();

// display_slider();
```

Everytime display functions are called, be sure to wrap them in `bsp_display_lock(0);` and `bsp_display_unlock();` to ensure no conflicts when trying to display using different threads/tasks.



### Touch version vs non-touch version

The example by default assumes that you are running the ST7789 Display with CST816 Touch IC. Other Touch IC's have not been tested yet.

If you have ST7789 Display without Touch, set the USE_TOUCH_DISPLAY define to 0. This define can be found at lvgl_setup.h
